# Pizza-Sales-Analysis--Excel
Created an interactive dashboard using Advanced Excel to analyze pizza sales data. Leveraged PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and conditional formatting to visualize key metrics like total revenue, order trends by day/hour, and top-selling pizzas. Applied functions such as SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, VLOOKUP, and date functions to extract insights. Identified peak order times (12 PM – 5 PM), top-selling category (Classic – Large), and helped highlight sales performance patterns.
